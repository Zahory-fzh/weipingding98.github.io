            <h1>Target and Motivation</h1>
            <p>Today, big data has become capital in both academia and industry fields, which is changing our world and
                the way we live at an unprecedented rate. Recent advances in computing technology allow us to gather and
                store large amounts of information from various fields, such as Internet, sensor monitoring systems,
                social networks, mobile communication systems, and transportation systems. Since big data contains
                greater variety arriving in increasing volumes and with ever-higher velocity, it is essential to develop
                new data mining and knowledge discovery techniques. Considering big data mining technologies, it still
                meet some serious problems requiring to be tackled, such as classification, clustering, regression,
                associate rules mining, and frequent pattern mining.</p>
            <p>In the past, the evolution of research interest has focused on a relatively new area—granular computing
                (GrC), based on fuzzy sets, rough sets, probabilistic granules, shadowed sets, and so on. GrC provides a
                powerful tool for multiple granularity and multiple-view data analysis, which is of vital importance for
                understanding data driven analysis at different granularity levels. Real-world big data often contain a
                significant amount of unstructured, uncertain and imprecise data, and GrC exhibits strong capabilities
                and advantages in intelligent data analysis, pattern recognition, machine learning, and uncertain
                reasoning. But how to integrate GrC and data mining to combine their advantages is an interesting and
                important research topic. As a meta-mathematical methodology, granular data mining gives a theoretical
                framework of big data analytics. It extracts knowledge from insufficient data, which can then be used in
                data mining for a new task/domain with big data.</p>
            <p>It has been a hot trend to address the classical and new-emerging data mining problems by using different
                granular computing approaches. The benefits of exploring the granular data mining in the knowledge
                reasoning scenario will have an impact in multiple research disciplines and industry domains, including
                transportation, communications, social network, medical health, and so on.</p>
